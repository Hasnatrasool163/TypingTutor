# Typing Tutor

A simple, interactive Java application designed to help users improve their typing skills through guided exercises. Built with Java Swing, it offers a user-friendly interface, real-time feedback on accuracy and speed, and levels of increasing difficulty to challenge users as they progress.

## Features

- **Interactive Typing Exercises**: Practice typing with exercises that increase in complexity, helping users improve both speed and accuracy.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate feedback on typing speed (Words Per Minute - WPM) and accuracy percentage.
- **Progressive Difficulty Levels**: Exercises are designed to get more challenging as the user progresses, encouraging continuous improvement.
- **Mistake Tracking**: Keeps track of the most frequently mistyped characters to help users identify areas for improvement.
- **Achievements**: Unlock achievements by reaching milestones such as completing levels, achieving high accuracy, or reaching a typing speed goal.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone <repository-url>

3. **Compile the Code**: Navigate to the directory containing the `TypingTutor.java` file and compile it using the Java compiler.

4. **Run the Application**: After compiling, you can run the application using the Java interpreter.


## How It Works

- **Start the Application**: Upon launching, you'll be greeted with a loading screen. Press any key to continue to the main interface.
- **Typing Exercises**: The application will display a text snippet for you to type. As you type, the color of the text will change to reflect your accuracy.
- **Feedback and Stats**: The bottom panel displays your current level, typing accuracy, and WPM. These stats are updated in real-time as you type.
- **Progressing Through Levels**: Complete the current exercise with sufficient accuracy and speed to unlock the next level. Mistyped characters are tracked, and frequently mistyped keys are highlighted at the end of each exercise.
- **Achievements**: Achieve specific milestones to receive acknowledgments for your progress.

## Dependencies

This project is built with Java Swing for the GUI components and does not require external libraries beyond the Java Development Kit (JDK).
